### Create Usage Guides

Use knowledge from the testing phase to create simple guides for registration, authentication and support. The support guide is for your team to note down common issues & how to solve them, you may want to share it with users or keep it private.

It's likely the guides will change before deployment and you may be supporting multiple authenticators in the pilot phase, so keep them simple for now.

Reference the [Users](/users/) section of this guide, if it helps!

{{< notice tip >}}
Offer detailed text and screen recorded guides, let users pick the style they want to use.

### Run a Pilot User Group

A good size for a pilot group is three to six users. Select the group so they have a wide variety of technical skill, seniority and job roles. This should give you some valuable feedback, whilst keeping support easy and minimizing negative impressions in the event of an issue.

{{< notice tip >}}
Use pilot groups as an opportunity to create advocates from directors and VPs, especially managers of operations teams, they'll love the increase in speed & focus!

Provide pilot users with the guides, but also schedule one-on-one or small group demonstration sessions to show them how to register & authenticate.

Feedback from this group can heavily impact your project. Increase the chances of positive feedback by making sure their first impressions are excellent!

Have the the group test WebAuthn as a second factor for one or two weeks, then collect their feedback and retrieve any cross-platform authenticators.

Use a simple feedback form and focus on comparisons to their previous way of authenticating. Keep the number of questions short and the questions themselves simple. These three questions would be enough:

1. How many times per day do you authenticate?
2. On a scale of 1 (much slower) to 5 (much faster), what was the speed of using WebAuthn as a second factor?
3. On a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot), how much would you like to continue using WebAuthn?

Repeat this process with more users if you need to improve your WebAuthn processes and settings. You're trying to create a group of people who can provide glowing testimonials about the operational value WebAuthn brings.
