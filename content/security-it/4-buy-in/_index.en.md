### Move On From Piloting

Once you've had a successful pilot group, which may happen first time, it's time to try and get buy-in from leadership to fully deploy WebAuthn in your environment.

Depending on where the initial idea came from, getting buy-in may be easy or hard for you. Luckily you have this guide to help fill in the gaps for different parts of your organization!

### Finding Advocates

Because your pilot group(s) just went so well, they're the perfect group of people to pull advocates from. Yes, your direct leadership should be onboard too, but there's nothing like cross-team collaboration to give a project more importance.

{{< notice tip >}}
Try to find an advocate who "does" whatever makes your organization money. If you rely on B2B sales, look for a senior Sales leader who will advocate for you. Remember to sell them on the aspects of WebAuthn that will make _their_ life easier.

### Focus on Business Improvement

Getting buy-in to make such a fundamental change often requires finding additional benefits on top of security. Use testimonials, data from your pilot group survey & video demonstrations of how easy WebAuthn is to use.

Highlight these benefits alongside the increases in security that WebAuthn offers. When cost is raised, be prepared with options for the time & financial requirements.

Customize messaging about WebAuthn for your audience. Everyone likes to see that you've considered how changes will affect their area.
