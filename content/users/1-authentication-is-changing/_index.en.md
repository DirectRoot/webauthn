### The Fight Against Phishing

Proving your identity (authentication) has a new technology called WebAuthn (pronounced "web-auth-N"), which is gaining popularity for stopping credential phishing attacks.

### The Future is Passwordless

Over the next few years, you're likely to hear more use of the term "passwordless". This is a term for authentication methods that **do not** rely on passwords or "shared secrets" to prove a user's identity.

{{< notice info >}}
A shared secret is string of characters, like a password or digit code, which you provide to a website during authentication. The website uses your knowledge of the shared secret to prove your identity.

Unfortunately, criminals have learnt to trick users into revealing the secrets required to authenticate; they then use the secrets themselves to gain unauthorized access.

### WebAuthn is Passwordless

WebAuthn is a passwordless form of authentication<sup>1</sup>, which can be deployed to make authentication easier and more secure.
