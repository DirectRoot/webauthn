### Quicker Authentication

Assuming your IT already requires Two Factor Authentication (2FA) to access systems, you'll find WebAuthn cuts your authentication time down.

Traditional 2FA might involve receiving an SMS message, push notification or retreiving a six digit code from an app. All of these require multiple systems to communicate & you to switch your focus to find the code or approve the push notification.

WebAuthn reduces authentication time by cutting reliance on multiple systems

### More Security

WebAuthn automatically creates unique authentication secrets for use with each website. WebAuthn also stops you ever sharing your authentication secrets with the legitimate or illegitimate websites.

Ask your IT & Security team to reduce their reliance on phishing education by deploying WebAuthn

### Fewer Distractions

A WebAuthn authenticatior is required to use WebAuthn, this can either be your device itself (platform authenticator) or a USB-like security key (cross-platform authenticator).

Either one can stop you needing your phone to authenticate, meaning you don't see **those** notifications that like to distract you at work!

### Optional Biometric Use

WebAuthn **does not** have to require the use of biometrics, even though some platforms will often refer to it as "biometric authentication".

WebAuthn **does** require proof of "user presence" **or** "user verification"<sup>1</sup>, but neither of these strictly require biometrics.

{{< notice info >}}
Platform authenticators can accept a device password for user verification. Cross-platform authenticators can use a touch sensor for user presence, which is not the same as a fingerprint sensor
