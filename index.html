The information targeted is often the login credentials for a popular online service, especially those offering a direct financial insentive or wider access to other systems.
Phishing is a prevalent attack on organizations; 75% of those surveyed1 reported an email-based attack in 2022, this includes phishing via email.
Social Engineering Phishers often rely on using social pressure or &ldquo;high-stakes&rdquo; situations to encourage a sense of panic or urgency in the victim, causing them to act without thinking.
Victims might find themselves receiving an email or SMS claiming to be from their IT department, ordering them to sign in and reset their credentials immediately to help stop a security breach; in reality, they&rsquo;re being tricked into creating the breach!
As the value of the information a user holds increases, so can the effort put into phishing them. Business leaders are often targetting through &ldquo;spear phishing&rdquo;, where personalized information is used to make the attack more convincing. The secrecy and urgency around business deals or other critical C-Level events can present highly valuable phishing opportunities.
Always question tasks that come to you with very high urgency and through an unusual channel. Separately confirm the action with the claimed sender, through a different method of communication
Your Second Factor Isn&rsquo;t Good Enough Unless your business is already using phishing resistant WebAuthn (pronounced &ldquo;web-auth-N&rdquo;), a phishing attack won&rsquo;t be stopped by your existing two factor authentication (2FA).
Simply having 2FA isn&rsquo;t enough. If you haven&rsquo;t already heard the term &ldquo;WebAuthn&rdquo; in your business, then your 2FA is likely vulnerable to phishing attacks
References Email Security Trends Report 2023, accessed May 2023 </p><p></p>`,url:"https://webauthn.direct-root.com/leaders/1-primer/"},{value:"Authentication is Changing",label:`<p>The Fight Against Phishing Proving your identity (authentication) has a new technology called WebAuthn (pronounced &ldquo;web-auth-N&rdquo;), which is gaining popularity for stopping credential phishing attacks.
It&rsquo;s not required, but you can read more about phishing in the leaders section of this guide.
The Future is Passwordless Over the next few years, you&rsquo;re likely to hear more use of the term &ldquo;passwordless&rdquo;. This is a term for authentication methods that do not rely on passwords or &ldquo;shared secrets&rdquo; to prove a user&rsquo;s identity.
A shared secret is string of characters, like a password or digit code, which you provide to a website during authentication. The website uses your knowledge of the shared secret to prove your identity.
Unfortunately, criminals have learnt to trick users into revealing the secrets required to authenticate; they then use the secrets themselves to gain unauthorized access.
WebAuthn is Passwordless WebAuthn is a passwordless form of authentication1, which can be deployed to make authentication easier and more secure.
Use this guide to help educate yourself and others in your organization about the use of WebAuthn
References WebAuthn Guide, accessed May 2023 </p><p>money</p><p>payment</p>`,url:"https://webauthn.direct-root.com/users/1-authentication-is-changing/"},{value:"Leaders",label:"<p></p>",url:"https://webauthn.direct-root.com/leaders/"},{value:"Your Goal",label:`<p>Eliminate TOTP &amp; Push Wherever it is technically possible, you should be removing the use of TOTP &amp; push notification as second factors.
WebAuthn is currently considered the most secure form of second factor available1, with push notifications second if WebAuthn isn&rsquo;t possible (more on that later).
Accounts are only as secure as their least secure authentication method. Enforce use of WebAuthn to improve your security.
Aim to achieve WebAuthn as a second factor, not a single passwordless authentication mechanism. Single factor WebAuthn is very difficult to make both secure and usable.
Stop Yubikey OTP A Yubikey filling in a random string of characters during authentication is not WebAuthn, it is an OTP. A Yubikey OTP is still a phishable credential, it&rsquo;s just a different style of one time password.
If you chose to use Yubikeys as part of your WebAuthn rollout, others may initially confuse WebAuthn as Yubikey OTP. You should make it clear that Yubikeys are just one way to &ldquo;do&rdquo; WebAuthn.
Improve User Experience Push notifications and retrieving TOTPs is slow, I used to regularly experience ten second delays between a push notification being sent, acknowledging it and being authenticated.
This doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, until you consider that one second is about the limit of time before a user&rsquo;s thought process is interrupted2.
Compound the distraction time with having to pick up a purposefully distracting phone to receive the notification, and it&rsquo;s easy to see how authentication flows become annoying for users by distracting them from their work.
Authenticating using WebAuthn allows users to leave their phone away from where they&rsquo;re working and authenticate with no distractions
References Consumer Authentication Security Maturity Model (Version 6), accessed July 2023 Response Times: The 3 Important Limits, accessed July 2023 </p><p></p>`,url:"https://webauthn.direct-root.com/security-it/1-your-goal/"},{value:"Testing",label:`<p>Understand Your Environment Before you start testing WebAuthn, it&rsquo;s first important to understand the combination of devices and workflows in your environment.
Any modern IdP will log device type, operating system and hopefully browser during authentication. If you don&rsquo;t already have this data in a system for analysis like Splunk or Elastic, now would be a great time to add it!
Use this data to determine the vital combinations of device and application that people use to get work done. Pay attention to; number of sign-ins per app, per device; average sign-ins per day, per app, per device; weekly, monthly or yearly trends of how sign-in patterns change.
Whatever the data tells you, test a wide array of devices &amp; apps. Use the most vital combinations of device &amp; app to focus your testing and documentation.
Select Your Authenticators Sign-in patterns should also determine what style and/or brand of authenticators to test.
If you&rsquo;re looking at 200-300 users all with the same hardware and Google Chrome, then maybe you don&rsquo;t need to buy Yubikeys.
If you&rsquo;ve got fewer users, but a much more varied landscape of devices &amp; browsers, then cross-platform authenticators have more value (especially if users have multiple devices).
See Name Your Price for guidelines on authenticators relating to company size.
Consider both the organization&rsquo;s size &amp; sign-in habits when selecting authenticators to test.
Start Testing By yourself, or in a small team, methodically test combinations of device, browser &amp; authenticator in the registration and authentication flow for a single app.
Use a sandbox IdP to help you understand how different settings in your IdP affect the ability to use the different authenticators. Experiment with &ldquo;user verification&rdquo; options, if they&rsquo;re available.
It&rsquo;s acceptable for user verification to be set as &ldquo;optional&rdquo; because the user&rsquo;s password will act as a verification step beforehand. If set to &ldquo;required&rdquo;, any authenticator will need to verify the user through a device password, biometric or pin before it can be used.
Browser support for platform authenticators is changing rapidly, so test browser support yourself. Remember to test the same browser across operating systems, the dialogues can be very different!
Once you&rsquo;ve thoroughly tested the registration and authentication flow of a single app, enable your immediate team to use WebAuthn for SSO.
Keep this group small and allow them to fall back to an existing second factor if there are any problems. Your aiming to have these trusted users test out WebAuthn in a wide variety of contexts over a few weeks or a month.
</p><p></p>`,url:"https://webauthn.direct-root.com/security-it/2-testing/"},{value:"The Benefits You'll See",label:`<p>Quicker Authentication Assuming your IT already requires Two Factor Authentication (2FA) to access systems, you&rsquo;ll find WebAuthn cuts your authentication time down.
Traditional 2FA might involve receiving an SMS message, push notification or retreiving a six digit code from an app. All of these require multiple systems to communicate &amp; you to switch your focus to find the code or approve the push notification.
WebAuthn reduces authentication time by cutting reliance on multiple systems
More Security WebAuthn automatically creates unique authentication secrets for use with each website. WebAuthn also stops you ever sharing your authentication secrets with the legitimate or illegitimate websites.
Ask your IT &amp; Security team to reduce their reliance on phishing education by deploying WebAuthn
Fewer Distractions A WebAuthn authenticatior is required to use WebAuthn, this can either be your device itself (platform authenticator) or a USB-like security key (cross-platform authenticator).
Either one can stop you needing your phone to authenticate, meaning you don&rsquo;t see those notifications that like to distract you at work!
Ask your leaders to help improve productivity &amp; focus by deploying WebAuthn
Optional Biometric Use WebAuthn does not have to require the use of biometrics, even though some platforms will often refer to it as &ldquo;biometric authentication&rdquo;.
WebAuthn does require proof of &ldquo;user presence&rdquo; or &ldquo;user verification&rdquo;1, but neither of these strictly require biometrics.
Platform authenticators can accept a device password for user verification. Cross-platform authenticators can use a touch sensor for user presence, which is not the same as a fingerprint sensor
References WebAuthn Authentication Ceremony Definition (&quot;&hellip;this includes a test of user presence or user verification&quot;), accessed May 2023 </p><p>handle</p>`,url:"https://webauthn.direct-root.com/users/2-the-benefits-you-will-see/"},{value:"The Outcome of Phishing",label:`<p>Unauthorized Access A successful phishing attack will result in unathorized access to your systems. Consider the industry standard (and correct) behaviour of using Single Sign On (SSO) systems and you&rsquo;ll see how one successful phishing attack can open a huge hole in your company&rsquo;s security.
Phishing is often used as the first step to gaining complete control over a company&rsquo;s data. Depending on the strength of your internal controls, a single phishing attack may be all it takes to lose the data that keeps your business running.
All the data in an employee&rsquo;s email &amp; cloud storage, all the data they work with on a daily basis, all the data they don&rsquo;t work with but have been given access to by default - it&rsquo;s all at risk once a phishing attack succeeds.
Corporate SSO is a huge target for phishing attacks. Read this guide and ask your IT/Security team, &ldquo;does our SSO support WebAuthn?&rdquo;
Financial Cost The dollar cost of a successful phishing attack is generally measured in the millions of dollars, with huge variations depending on the extent of the resulting compromise.
That cost is also getting larger, with a phishing attack quadrupling in cost between 2015 &amp; 2021 from $3.8M to $14.8M1.
Breach cost climbs if customer data is exposed. In 2022, T-Mobile settled a class action suit resulting from a breach for $350M2

The support guide is for your team to note down common issues &amp; how to solve them, you may want to share it with users or keep it private.
It&rsquo;s likely the guides will change before deployment and you may be supporting multiple authenticators in the pilot phase, so keep them simple for now.
Reference the Users section of this guide, if it helps!
Offer detailed text and screen recorded guides, let users pick the style they want to use.
Run a Pilot User Group A good size for a pilot group is three to six users. Select the group so they have a wide variety of technical skill, seniority and job roles. This should give you some valuable feedback, whilst keeping support easy and minimizing negative impressions in the event of an issue.
Use pilot groups as an opportunity to create advocates from directors and VPs, especially managers of operations teams, they&rsquo;ll love the increase in speed &amp; focus!
Provide pilot users with the guides, but also schedule one-on-one or small group demonstration sessions to show them how to register &amp; authenticate.
Feedback from this group can heavily impact your project. Increase the chances of positive feedback by making sure their first impressions are excellent!
Have the the group test WebAuthn as a second factor for one or two weeks, then collect their feedback and retrieve any cross-platform authenticators.
Use a simple feedback form and focus on comparisons to their previous way of authenticating. Keep the number of questions short and the questions themselves simple. These three questions would be enough:
How many times per day do you authenticate? On a scale of 1 (much slower) to 5 (much faster), what was the speed of using WebAuthn as a second factor? On a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot), how much would you like to continue using WebAuthn? Repeat this process with more users if you need to improve your WebAuthn processes and settings. You&rsquo;re trying to create a group of people who can provide glowing testimonials about the operational value WebAuthn brings.

Terminology Authenticator - The hardware used to help you authenticate Platform authenticator - An authenticator built into a device like a laptop or phone Cross-platform authenticator - An authenticator that can be used across different devices, like a Yubikey or Google Titan Key Passkey - An implementation of WebAuthn meant to make usage easier for consumers. When you&rsquo;re registering a platform authenticator, you might be prompted to save a passkey. Registration Once you know what kind of authenticator(s) your organization is going to use, you&rsquo;ll need to go through a registration process; it&rsquo;s likely that this will happen within your Single Sign-On (SSO) platform.
You&rsquo;ll first need to login using your existing 2FA and start the registration process from your account settings. Once you&rsquo;ve completed the registration process, your authenticator can be used when signing in.
Each new system where you want to use WebAuthn will require you to go through a registration process. But, if your applications are well integrated with SSO then you probably won&rsquo;t need to register anywhere else.
Authentication When authenticating using WebAuthn, your browser might ask you what kind of authenticator you want to use. A cross-platform authenticator might be referred to as a &ldquo;security key&rdquo; &amp; using a platform authenticator could be a &ldquo;passkey&rdquo;.
If you&rsquo;re using a cross-platform authenticator that works over USB (like a Yubikey), it only has to be inserted into your device during authentication. You can remove it once you&rsquo;ve signed in.
Registering a platform authenticator will only allow you sign in from that device. A cross-platform authenticator can be used on any device that supports it, for example it could be registered via a laptop, removed &amp; used with a phone
</p><p></p>`,url:"https://webauthn.direct-root.com/users/3-what-you-need-to-do/"},{value:"Why Phishing Keeps Happening",label:`<p>Weak Second Factors 2FA will remain more secure than using a single factor, but malicious actors have evolved so that the most popular second factors are now relatively easy to circumvent.
SMS It&rsquo;s generally accepted that SMS One Time Passcodes (OTPs) are insecure in both consumer &amp; corporate settings. &ldquo;Sim swapping&rdquo; attacks allow a malicious takeover of a phone number, meaning the OTP can be delivered directly to the attacker.
Time-based One Time Passcodes (TOTP) A TOTP from a mobile application is often the most secure second factor available to consumers and is regularly accepted in corporations too.
Whilst the TOTP rotating every thirty seconds seems to make it more secure, the 0ktapus hacking campaign1 has proven criminals are very capable of phishing employees for password + TOTP in real time to gain access.
0ktapus has led to over 130 companies, 10k passwords and 5k TOTPs being compromised
Push Notifications Whilst removing (T)OTPs means there&rsquo;s no passcode to phish, relying on app push notifications doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem. After phishing or discovering an employees password, a hacker can utilize MFA fatigue to eventually gain access.
MFA fatigue requires bombarding the victim with constant notifications until they relent and approve the sign in. This sounds far-fetched until you imagine receiving multiple notifications at night, whilst driving or during critical meetings. MFA fatigue was successfully used to compromise Uber in 20222.
Push notifications can&rsquo;t be phished, but the human element makes them vulnerable to attack
Relying on Education The approach to stopping phishing in corporations has often relied on educating the user and following up with phishing tests, reports &amp; extra education for those deemed to have &ldquo;failed&rdquo;. Whilst security education is beneficial, it is not enough to stop a sustained phishing campaign.
Consider vehicle safety, we educate drivers to avoid mistakes but we also accept that they&rsquo;ll happen. Because of this, we use technology to improve the outcomes when they do. Picking a weak second factor and relying on education to stop phishing is equivalent to removing seatbelts and telling drivers, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mess up&rdquo;.
Using phishing-resistant WebAuthn removes the human error that phishing relies upon

Depending on where the initial idea came from, getting buy-in may be easy or hard for you. Luckily you have this guide to help fill in the gaps for different parts of your organization!
Finding Advocates Because your pilot group(s) just went so well, they&rsquo;re the perfect group of people to pull advocates from. Yes, your direct leadership should be onboard too, but there&rsquo;s nothing like cross-team collaboration to give a project more importance.
Try to find an advocate who &ldquo;does&rdquo; whatever makes your organization money. If you rely on B2B sales, look for a senior Sales leader who will advocate for you. Remember to sell them on the aspects of WebAuthn that will make their life easier.
Focus on Business Improvement Getting buy-in to make such a fundamental change often requires finding additional benefits on top of security. Use testimonials, data from your pilot group survey &amp; video demonstrations of how easy WebAuthn is to use.
Highlight these benefits alongside the increases in security that WebAuthn offers. When cost is raised, be prepared with options for the time &amp; financial requirements.
Customize messaging about WebAuthn for your audience. Everyone likes to see that you&rsquo;ve considered how changes will affect their area.
</p><p></p>`,url:"https://webauthn.direct-root.com/security-it/4-buy-in/"},{value:"How to Stop Phishing",label:`<p>Require WebAuthn If you&rsquo;re serious about stopping phishing, you need to insist on the use of WebAuthn as a second factor for all human access to your systems, especially SSO.
CloudFlare stopped the previously mentioned 0ktapus campaign using the predecessor to WebAuthn called Universal Second Factor (U2F)1
WebAuthn is gaining traction and being touted as the beginning of a passwordless future2. In reality, operational challenges &amp; standardization across vendors means WebAuthn is currently best used in combination with a password. If a password is phished, the WebAuthn second factor should stop the attacker gaining access.
Using WebAuthn as a second factor is good enough, you don&rsquo;t need to go full &ldquo;passwordless&rdquo; to benefit
Although often used with biometrics, WebAuthn does not require their use. You can go completely phishing-resistant without them.

The larger your organization, the higher quality the onboarding documentation needs to be. You be able to help everyone 1-on-1 like you did with the pilot group.
As before, create both text &amp; video onboarding guides to allow people a choice.
Re-record videos you made during the pilot stage, it&rsquo;s still common for WebAuthn dialogues in browsers to change. Visual differences in dialogues can put off less technical users.
Creative Support &amp; Education Particularly in larger organizations, you might have to be creative with how you offer support &amp; education to your users.
Consider the following to increase end-user confidence in the project:
High-level presentations at all-hands or departmental meetings Video comparisons of the benefits they&rsquo;ll get from WebAuthn Technical, deep-dive presentations for people who want to know how WebAuthn works Pre-booked &ldquo;Office Hours&rdquo; where users can come for dedicated support or to ask questions This project will affect everyone in your organization, use it to demonstrate that IT/Security are there to make things better for users - we don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;no&rdquo;
Rollout I highly recommend splitting the rollout of WebAuthn into three phases
Authenticator Deployment Whatever selection of authenticator you&rsquo;re going to use, get them into the hands of your users first. Warn people if you&rsquo;re going to be mailing a cross-platform authenticator to them.
If you&rsquo;re using platform authenticators only, confirm that your fleet of devices has the right hardware for WebAuthn.
Encourage users with cross-platform authenticators to add them onto their physical key chain as soon as they arrive. Expect that some users will immediately lose their authenticator, regardless.
Users are anxious to avoid being locked out. Moving onto registration &amp; usage too quickly can be concerning for users who haven&rsquo;t received their authenticator yet.
Registration Period Once you&rsquo;re at least 80% deployed with authenticators, configure your IdP to allow user registration of WebAuthn authenticators.
Use your documentation and &ldquo;Registration Office Hours&rdquo; to allow independent &amp; guided registration.
Make use of WebAuthn optional at this point. Just like you did with the pilot group, allow users to fallback to other authentication methods if required.
The registration period should last a number of weeks, at least four to six weeks with organizations over 1000 users.
Do not attempt to restrict registration to specific types of authenticator. The functionality in IdP&rsquo;s is still immature and the extra complexity is not currently worth it.
Even if you&rsquo;re using cross-platform authenticators, encourage users to register their corporate devices as authenticators now.
Your IdP may remember the last authentication method that a user used. Encourage users to select the WebAuthn method for use once they&rsquo;ve registered, whilst reassuring them that the old method will keep working during the registration period.
Cut Over Period Immediately after the registration period, configure your IdP so that you&rsquo;re able to enforce use of WebAuthn on a specific group of users. You&rsquo;ll still be allowing registration, and will continue to do so.
The cut over period should also last several weeks, but can be shorter than the registration period because the majority of your users should have already taken the action they need to.
Begin placing users who have already registered in the enforcement group, starting with a few each day and slowly ramping up to include all registered users towards the end of the period.
There will always be people who leave tasks to the last minute, so increase messaging &amp; the availability of 1-on-1 support in the last week of the period and the first week after.
If you&rsquo;ve run the cut over correctly, the final day of the period should pass by unnoticed by almost all of your organization; they&rsquo;re already using WebAuthn, so it won&rsquo;t matter that you&rsquo;re not enforcing its use everywhere.
Use a random selection of registered users each time you add more to the enforcement group. Ramping up by department or other grouping risks leaving problems until later &amp; creating a bigger blast radius if something does go wrong.
The slow ramp up of enforcement allows you to test enforced WebAuthn on a growing number of users, whilst giving you time to fix problems before the end of the cut over period.

Deploy WebAuthn for little to no money, with relative easePaying for WebAuthn technology is a good ideaInvest in your WebAuthn deployment, for the sake of your users & technical teams!What Do We Need to Buy? The technology costs for WebAuthn are the SSO platform and hardware authenticators that enable users to sign in.
There are also hidden costs in operational complexity, user education &amp; support. Appropriate spending on technology can reduce the hidden costs
The SSO Platform If you're already using a SSO platform built for the web, the chances are you've already got WebAuthn supportGood open-source SSO platforms should support WebAuthn, for example Keycloak. You will incur some extra costs to have your own team install, run & maintain this softwareMajor Identity as a Service (IDaaS) providers should all support WebAuthn, for example Okta or OneLoginThe Hardware Authenticators Using Chrome or Safari on relatively modern hardware will enable you to use your devices themselves as platform authenticators, Firefox should be adding support for this in the future. Both mobile & desktop/laptop devices can be used as platform authenticators You will incur some extra operational complexity when users need to sign into the SSO platform from multiple devices, because the authenticator is tied to each device. This is explained in more detail within the Security & IT sectionCross platform authenticators are external hardware resembling a USB stick, allowing users to register the authenticator once and use it on multiple devices.Modern versions of Yubico's well-known Yubikey can act as WebAuthn authenticators. See the Security & IT section for differences between Yubico OTP and WebAuthn.Google also sell a viable authenticator as the Titan Security Key. These can be cheaper per unit than a Yubikey, but larger or more dispersed organizations might prefer to buy Yubikeys and use Yubico's YubiEnterprise Delivery to handle logistics.</p><p></p>`,url:"https://webauthn.direct-root.com/leaders/5-name-your-price/"},{value:"Maintenance",label:`<p>Enforcement Now you&rsquo;ve reached 100% of users authenticating with WebAuthn as a second factor, you need to maintain that rate.
Ensure changes to processes &amp; authentication policies do not allow for arbitrary exceptions to humans using WebAuthn.
Exceptions can be granted when WebAuthn is not technically possible (some mobile apps &amp; embedded browsers suffer from this). Exceptions may also be required to allow user to register new WebAuthn authenticators. In both cases, enforce the use of non-OTP second factors, generally a push notification.
Focus on enforcing the use of WebAuthn, not a particular authenticator. Users will appreciate the flexibility and it gives you options when specific hardware or app combinations don&rsquo;t work.
When registering new authenticators, it should be possible to configure your IdP so users can register an authenticator without using WebAuthn, but cannot access an application.
A user registering their first (or replacing their only) authenticator increases their phishing risk. You&rsquo;ll be letting them into your IdP using a less secure second factor, so be sure to fully enforce the use of WebAuthn, once they&rsquo;ve registered the authenticator.
Replacing Cross Platform Authenticators Cross platform authenticators have a particular risk of loss, depending on their shape &amp; size they can also be broken with relative ease. Ensure your budget or contract for cross-platform authenticators includes a provision for replacing them, a 15% yearly replacement rate should be plenty.
If you encouraged users to register their devices as platform authenticators during the registration period, someone losing their cross-platform authenticator should not lock them out.
Include cross platform authenticators in your IT care policy &amp; encourage users to report their loss like any other IT asset.
Losing cross platform authenticators is inevitable, avoiding full &ldquo;passwordless&rdquo; gives you extra protection when this happens.
Reusing Cross Platform Authenticators When users leave your organization, it&rsquo;s perfectly safe to reuse their cross platform authenticator with another user. Use your IdP to revoke the WebAuthn registration on the user&rsquo;s last day, then have them return the authenticator with their corporate device(s).
Once you have the authenticator in your hands, use its management software to reset WebAuthn/FIDO2 credentials. Once you&rsquo;ve done this, it&rsquo;s ready for use again.
</p><p></p>`,url:"https://webauthn.direct-root.com/security-it/6-maintenance/"},{value:"Common Issues",label:`<p>Multiple Devices &amp; Platform Authenticators Choosing an approach based entirely on platform authenticators can make using multiple devices harder.
As a user&rsquo;s second factor is tied to the device they registered with, you&rsquo;ll find extra operational toil when users get a new phone or computer.
Create a standard process for users to gain access via push notification 2FA whilst registering a new platform authenticator. Automate revoking the ability to authenticate with anything other than WebAuthn
Embedded Browsers &amp; Mobile Apps As WebAuthn is a an API implemented in browsers, apps which use &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; browsers as part of their authentication can sometimes not support WebAuthn. Sometimes WebAuthn support can vary between desktop browser &amp; mobile apps for this reason.
When this happens, you&rsquo;ll generally see a response in the sign in window similar to, &ldquo;the operation is not supported&rdquo;.
Pre-create an authentication policy that can be applied to apps that don&rsquo;t support WebAuthn. A slow rollout, with fallback options, should allow you to spot &amp; handle these cases before fully cutting over
Refusal to Carry a Cross Platform Authenticator Some users will refuse to carry their security key, despite the small size &amp; weight. This is fine, just have them register their device as a platform authenticator.
Your flexibility to allow any kind of WebAuthn authenticator is what will allow you to effectively ban all other kinds of 2FA
Resistance to Platform Authenticators Some users will be cautious about registering their personal devices as platform authenticators for fear of device monitoring, sometimes they will also be the same people who refuse to carry a security key!
Educating security teams &amp; your users is critical for a successful rollout. Be sure to separate any discussions about WebAuthn from those about employee tracking, device monitoring or mobile device management. Those technologies have their appropriate time &amp; place, but WebAuthn is nothing to do with them.

I have personally found it difficult to get a straight answer and end-to-end guidance about WebAuthn because guides I found were trying to sell me their product, or evangelize about WebAuthn in general. It&rsquo;s easy to convince Security/IT geeks (myself included) about the value of WebAuthn, this guide helps you apply it in your environment.
